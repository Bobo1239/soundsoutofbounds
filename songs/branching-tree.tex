\subsection{Branching Tree}
\songinfo{Fool's Garden -- Lemon Tree}{Dominik Schreiber}

I'm \chord{a}sitting here in a \chord{e}boring room \\
The \chord{a}program must compile until to\chord{e}morrow noon \\
I'm \chord{a}wasting my time, looking \chord{e}for a bug \\
For \chord{a}hours and hours I am \chord{e}trying my luck \\
But no\chord{d}thing ever happens \chord{e}- and I wo\chord{a}nder. \chord{e \ \ a} \\

My partner tells me, \glqq Everything's fine, \\
I fixed that problem on my branch for quite some time \\
Just fetch and merge, stage and commit \\
and don't forget to push -- that should be it\grqq \\
But nothing ever happens -- and I wonder. \\

\refrain{
	I \chord{C}wonder how, I \chord{G}wonder why, \chord{a}Git does seem so easy for that \chord{e}other guy \\
	but all\chord{d} that I can see\chord{G} is just the giant \chord{C}branching tree. \chord{G} \\
	I \chord{C}pull and push \chord{G}every time, still \chord{a}merging conflicts haunt me every \chord{e}second line \\
	and all\chord{d} that I can \chord{D}see is just that giant \chord{G}branching tree.}

Sing, \chord{a}Git  \\
\chord{e} Gididi di \chord{a}Gidi-git \\
\chord{e} Gididi di di \chord{d}Gidi git \\
\chord{e} I can’t commit\chord{a}. \ \ \chord{e \ \ a} \\

I’m sitting here, still no success \\
I’m understanding less and less \\
A dirty worktree? What is that? \\
My eyes are heavy, I wish for my bed \\
While nothing ever happens and I wonder \\

\chord{E} Compilation \chord{a}is so far away \\
\chord{G} Compilation -- \chord{C}I start thinking \chord{E} I just should start to pray \\

My \chord{a}IDE de\chord{e}synchronized \\
My \chord{a}commands still not \chord{e}recognized \\
And \chord{d}nothing ever happens \chord{e}- and I won\chord{a}der. \chord{e \ \ a}  \\

\refrain{
	I wonder how, I wonder why -- Git does seem so easy for that other guy \\
	but all that I can see is just the giant branching tree. \\
	I pull and push every time, still merging conflicts haunt me every second line \\
	and all that I can see is just that giant branching tree. \\
	And I wonder, wonder \\
	
	I  \chord{C}wonder how, I \chord{G}wonder why \\
	\chord{a}Someone told me Git was easy \chord{e}- What a lie! \\
	And I\chord{d} can’t even see\chord{G} \\
	And I\chord{F} can’t even see\chord{G} \\
	And I\chord{F} can’t even see\chord{G} \\
	The branching tree \chord{C}anymore.}
