\subsection{The Final Countdown}
\songinfo{Europe -- The Final Countdown}{Dominik Schreiber}

\chord{f\#} We’re coding together, but still so \chord{h}far away \\
\chord{f\#} And after we merged it, will it \chord{G\#/E}work, who can \chord{A}tell? \\
\chord{D} I guess the \chord{E}server is to blame \\
\chord{A} We’re \chord{G\#/E}squashing \chord{f\#}bugs (\chord{E}squashing \chord{D}bugs) \\
Will the system \chord{C\#}ever work again? \chord{E}\\

\refrain{
	It’s the final \chord{f\#}countdown \chord{D} \ \ \chord{h} \\
	\chord{E} The final \chord{f\#}countdown \chord{D} \ \ \chord{h} \ \chord{E} -- \chord{C\#}Oh }

We’re heading for features (features) which the client wants \\
‘Cause maybe he’ll try it (try it) and then scold us all, yeah \\
With so many lines still to go \\
And bugs to be found (to be found) \\
Eventually we’ll just make it worse \\

\refrain{
	It's the final count down \\
	(We're coding together) \\
	The final count down \\
	(We just make it worse) \\
	It's the final countdown \\
	It's the final countdown \\
	Oh -- It's the final countdown, yeah}
